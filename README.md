# Music Visualizer with React, Three.js, and Tone.js

## Introduction

This project aims to create a real-time audio visualizer using React for the frontend, Three.js for 3D rendering, and Tone.js for audio manipulation. The visualizer synchronizes with the audio played, producing 3D line segments that change with the waveform.

## Features

- Real-time audio visualization
- 3D graphics rendered with Three.js
- Audio handled by Tone.js
- Toggle to start and stop visualization
